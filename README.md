Walk-In Refrigerated Room Analysis Tool

Commercial Cooler & Freezer Load Calculator — ASHRAE-Aligned










🛠️ Overview

The Walk-In Refrigerated Room Analysis Tool is a branded, guided, and highly accurate sizing calculator for commercial walk-in coolers and freezers.
It uses ASHRAE-aligned engineering principles to calculate required BTU/hr based on:

Ambient conditions

Box dimensions

Insulation and doors

Internal and product loads

Usage patterns

Evaporator TD and system type

This tool reduces guesswork for estimators and delivers clear, contractor-ready equipment recommendations.

🚀 Key Features
✔ ASHRAE-Aligned Heat Load Calculation

Dynamic and accurate: insulation U-values, infiltration factors, personnel heat, product enthalpy, and more.

✔ Guided Autofill System

Choosing a Primary Application auto-populates:

Desired box temperature

Relative humidity

Internal load baselines

Typical usage levels

✔ Mechanical Temp Branding

Clean, streamlined, customer-ready form flow.

✔ Full Load Breakdown

Outputs each category individually:

Transmission Load

Infiltration Load

Internal Load

Product Load

✔ Built-In Cheatsheet

Section 8 includes quick reference values:

Evaporator TD

R-Values

Typical walk-in temperatures

Panel thickness guides

📝 How to Use the Tool

The tool is divided into eight collapsible sections.
Go through them in order, as early inputs affect the final calculation.

Sections Overview
Section	Purpose	Key Inputs
1. Contact & Submission	Customer info & operating mode.	Primary Application, Box Usage.
2. Box Specs & Environment	Physical size & ambient conditions.	L/W/H, Ambient Temp.
3. Insulation & Door Details	Heat resistance & leakage points.	Insulation Type, Number of Doors.
4. Internal Loads & Product	Product chilling & human/lighting loads.	Product Type, lbs/day, Pulldown Hours.
5. Refrigeration System	System type & available power.	Refrigerant, TD, Voltage/Phase.
6. Comments	Special site notes.	Irregular shapes, access issues.
7. Load Calculation	Final BTU/hr & equipment recommendation.	Click Calculate Load.
8. Cheatsheet	Quick lookup of common data.	TD ranges, R-values, temps.
💡 Quick Sizing Pointers
Concept	Why It Matters	Best Practice
Box Usage	Door openings drive infiltration load.	“Long Storage” for low traffic, “Heavy” for frequent access.
Evaporator TD	Controls humidity & coil size.	6–8°F = freezers/high humidity, 10–12°F = general coolers.
Product Load	Can dominate total load if pulldown is short.	Confirm lbs/day + pulldown hours.
Insulation Type	Defines U-value and energy loss.	Polyurethane recommended.
Safety Factor	Ensures real-world buffer.	15% automatically added.
