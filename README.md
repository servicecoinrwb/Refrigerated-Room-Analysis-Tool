Walk-In Refrigerated Room Analysis Tool

🛠️ Overview

This tool is a comprehensive, branded, and guided data collection form for sizing commercial walk-in coolers and freezers. It uses ASHRAE-aligned principles to quickly calculate the required cooling capacity (BTU/hr) based on ambient conditions, box specifications, and usage loads.

The goal is to simplify the sizing process for estimators, minimizing guesswork through autofill features and providing clear, actionable equipment recommendations.

🚀 Key Features

ASHRAE-Aligned Calculation: Uses dynamic variables (e.g., U-values based on insulation, dynamic personnel heat gain) for more accurate results than generic calculators.

Guided Autofill: Automatically populates Desired Temperature/Humidity and Internal Load estimates based on the chosen Primary Application (e.g., Restaurant, Freezer).

Branding & Simplicity: Features Mechanical Temp branding and a highly streamlined, section-by-section workflow.

Cheatsheet (Section 8): Includes quick reference material on Evaporator TD, R-values, and typical temperatures for rapid look-up.

Load Breakdown: Provides a detailed breakdown of the total BTU load into its four components (Transmission, Infiltration, Internal, and Product).

📝 How to Use the Tool (Workflow)

The form is organized into eight collapsible sections. To ensure an accurate calculation, proceed through the sections sequentially, as inputs from earlier sections affect the calculation in Section 7.

Section

Purpose

Key Inputs to Check

1. Contact & Submission

Documents the customer and sets key operating modes.

Primary Application (Autofills Temp/RH) and Box Usage (Autofills Internal Loads).

2. Box Specs & Environment

Defines physical space and exterior conditions.

Box Dimensions (Long, Wide, High) and Ambient Temperature.

3. Insulation & Door Details

Defines heat transfer resistance and air leakage points.

Insulation Type (sets panel U-Value for calculation). Total Doors is critical for Infiltration.

4. Internal Loads & Product

Defines product chilling, lighting, and human heat contribution.

Product Type (sets Specific Heat/Respiration Load). Max Load (lbs/day) and Pull Down Hours.

5. Refrigeration System

Documents intended system type and available power.

Refrigerant, Desired Evaporator TD, and Electrical Power (Voltage/Phase).

6. Comments

Capture non-standard details or site notes.

Any irregular shapes, access issues, or special equipment.

7. Load Calculation

Output the results.

Click the 'Calculate Load' button to generate the required BTU/hr and equipment recommendation.

8. Cheatsheet

Reference common standards.

Quick-look data for TD, R-values, and target temperatures.

Field/Concept

Why It Matters

Best Practice

Box Usage

Directly scales the Infiltration Load (door opening frequency).

Use 'Long Storage' for low-traffic storage; 'Heavy' for high-volume processing.

Evaporator TD

Determines coil size and box humidity.

Low TD (6-8°F) for freezers and sensitive produce (high humidity). Medium TD (10-12°F) for general chill.

Product Load

Often the largest single load if pulldown time is short.

Always confirm Max Load (lbs/day) and Pull Down Hours. Shorter time = higher required capacity.

Insulation Type

Sets the R-Value. Assumes standard 4" panel thickness in calculation.

Polyurethane provides the highest insulation (lowest heat loss).

Safety Factor

A 15% safety factor is automatically added to the total load in Section 7 to account for variations and future proofing.

This ensures the recommended equipment has margin for error.
