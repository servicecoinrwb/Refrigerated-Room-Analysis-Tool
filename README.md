Walk-In Refrigerated Room Analysis Tool

Commercial Cooler & Freezer Load Calculator — ASHRAE-Aligned










🛠️ Overview

The Walk-In Refrigerated Room Analysis Tool is a branded, guided, and highly accurate cooling load calculator for commercial walk-in coolers and freezers. It uses ASHRAE-aligned engineering principles to calculate required BTU/hr based on:

Ambient conditions

Box dimensions

Insulation and doors

Internal and product loads

Usage patterns

Evaporator TD and system type

This tool reduces estimator guesswork and outputs clear, contractor-ready equipment recommendations.

🚀 Key Features

📝 How to Use the Tool

The form is divided into eight collapsible sections.
Complete them in order, as early inputs affect the final calculation.

Section Overview
Section	Purpose	Key Inputs
1. Contact & Submission	Customer info & base settings	Primary Application, Usage Pattern
2. Box Specs & Environment	Physical space & ambient	Dimensions, Ambient Temp
3. Insulation & Door Details	Heat transfer inputs	Insulation Type, Doors
4. Internal Loads & Product	Daily product load & internal heat	Product Type, lbs/day, Pulldown Hours
5. Refrigeration System	Refrigeration mode & power	Refrigerant, TD, Voltage/Phase
6. Comments	Site-specific notes	Access, irregular shapes
7. Load Calculation	Final BTU/hr results	Click Calculate Load
8. Cheatsheet	Reference values	TD, R-values, Temps
💡 Quick Sizing Pointers
Concept	Why It Matters	Best Practice
Box Usage	Door openings drive infiltration	Choose accurately (Long Storage vs Heavy Use)
Evaporator TD	Controls humidity & coil size	6–8°F for freezers; 10–12°F for coolers
Product Load	Can dominate load for short pulldown	Confirm lbs/day + hours
Insulation Type	Sets U-value	Polyurethane is preferred
Safety Factor	Provides real-world buffer	Tool automatically adds 15%
